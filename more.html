	<h1 class="header">What I've Learned</h1>

	<div class="content">
		<p>One of the few things that I've learned, while at Archer Malmo, was that Archer Malmo are strategic brains, creative souls, and independent spirits, wired for adaptation in a culture that never stops demanding it. Their strength is their ability to help growing brands evolve both digitally and creatively to compete with bigger and smaller rivals. Archer Malmo has over 200 talented Memphians and Austinites, there in-house capabilities span the breadth of straegic planning, creative, digital, PR, media, and production services.</p>
	
		<p>During the Archer Malmo field trip, I saw some really cool things, like a popcorn machine on the 5<sup>th</sup> floor (main lobby), and the production studio located on the lower level, where they create their films and edit them for the public. They also make worlds for VR (Virtual Reality, which I didn't know). We had even driven past my dad's apartment (which suprised me the most). Other than not learning anything new/different about Archer Malmo, I honestly had a good time, it was a fun experience going somewhere I haven't been to before and still had a blast</p>

		<h2 class="header">Lunch</h2>
		<p>After the field trip we went to Cookout for lunch, and while there I had Out West Style burger, a Peach Cobbler milkshake, and a large Coke (which I found really good, since I haven't had it in a long while). My friend Spencer Phillips had some difficulties seeing the menu from where we were in the line and he said
"I should've brought mai glasses, cause I can't see", we also had a very interesting conversation, which I think was about FedEx (I don't remember what it was that we were talking about)                                                   ヽ( •_)ᕗ
</p>


		<p>I honestly couldn't think of anything else to type (I mostly forgot everything else that we did</p>
